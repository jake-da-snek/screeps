# screeps

These are my custom scripts for the JavaScript programming MMO, Screeps. These are the basic modules for standard creep roles. They may need to be modified depending on the dynamics of the room or hostile players surrounding the room (e.g. place a heavier emphasis on defense as opposed to upgrading).
